        <p class="align-center"><i>Real Estate categories</i></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Residential real estate</b> includes both new construction and resale homes. The most common
                category is single-family homes. There are also condominiums, co-ops, townhouses, duplexes,
                triple-deckers, quadplexes, high-value homes, multi-generational and vacation homes. </li>
            <li><b>Commercial real estate</b> includes shopping centers and strip malls, medical and educational
                buildings, hotels and offices. Apartment buildings are often considered commercial, even though they
                are used for residences. That's because they are owned to produce income.</li>
            <li><b>Industrial real estate</b> includes manufacturing buildings and property, as well as warehouses. The
                buildings can be used for research, production, storage and distribution of goods. Some buildings that
                distribute goods are considered commercial real estate. The classification is important because the
                zoning, construction and sales are handled differently.</li>
            <li><b>Land</b> includes vacant land, working farms and ranches. The subcategories within vacant land
                include undeveloped, early development or reuse, subdivision and site assembly. </li>
        </ol>
